# meta-jq
Tools for processing [jq](https://jqlang.org/) queries using jq itself (via a JSON representation of jq queries).

## jq

[jq](https://jqlang.org/) is a declarative language to transform JSON.
It is described by its authors as being "like sed for JSON data".
It can also be seen as being to JSON what languages like XQuery and XSLT are to XML.

## jq Queries as JSON

Declarative languages like jq are not tied to specific implementations and execution contexts.
It thus possible to manipulate the structure of scripts (which in the case of jq are called queries) for a number of reasons: perform pre-execution optimizations, adapt to different contexts, port to different languages, conform to specific rules, ...
Ideally, it would be good to do it in jq itself to avoid depending on other tool/languages.

To manipulate jq queries using other jq queries, the jq language needs to be representable as JSON.
Albeit there is currently no documented standard, the closer thing is the output generated by the jq parser of [gojq](https://github.com/itchyny/gojq).
